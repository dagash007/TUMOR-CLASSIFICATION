# TUMOR-CLASSIFICATION
TUMOR CLASSIFICATION
This is a deep learning classification project to classify whether a tumor is malignant or benign on a breast cancer diagnosis dataset with keras in TensorFlow. 
EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS
•	Used the Pandas info, head, describe and is null methods to do a quick exploration of the data.
•	Performed a count plot using seaborn visualization library to view the benign/malignant label in the data.
•	Checked the correlation between other features and benign/malignant feature in the data. 
TRAIN TEST SPLIT AND SCALING THE DATA
•	Selected our X and y variables and performed a train test split on them.
•	Scaled the X_train and X_test data to normalise them.
